# Step Definitions Refactoring

This document outlines the improvements made to the step definitions structure in the automation exercise test suite.

## Problem Statement

The original `AutomationExerciseSteps.java` file had several issues:

1. **Single Responsibility Violation**: All step definitions were in one large file
2. **Poor Maintainability**: Difficult to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Code Duplication**: Repeated patterns across methods
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mixed "User" and "I" personas
5. **Lack of Validation**: Missing input validation and error handling
6. **Actor Management**: No centralized actor lifecycle management

## Solution

The monolithic step definitions file has been refactored into multiple specialized classes:

### New Structure

```
steps/
├── AuthenticationSteps.java    # Login, logout, authentication validations
├── NavigationSteps.java        # Page navigation and routing
├── RegistrationSteps.java      # User registration and account creation
├── ShoppingCartSteps.java      # Cart management functionality
├── Hooks.java                  # Scenario setup and teardown
├── StepContext.java           # Actor state management
└── AutomationExerciseSteps.java # Deprecated - marked for removal
```

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **AuthenticationSteps**: Handles all login/logout related functionality
- **NavigationSteps**: Manages page navigation and routing
- **RegistrationSteps**: Focuses on user registration workflows
- **ShoppingCartSteps**: Dedicated to shopping cart operations

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Input validation for DataTable parameters
- Descriptive error messages for malformed data
- Proper exception handling with meaningful messages

#### 3. Improved Documentation
- Comprehensive JavaDoc for all methods
- Clear parameter descriptions
- Usage examples and error conditions

#### 4. Centralized Actor Management
- `StepContext` class manages actor lifecycle
- Consistent actor access across all step files
- Proper cleanup to prevent state leakage

#### 5. Better Code Organization
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Consistent naming conventions
- Reduced code duplication

### Migration Guide

#### Before (Single File)
```java
public class AutomationExerciseSteps {
    // 200+ lines mixing all concerns
    private Actor user;
    
    @Before
    public void setUpActor() { ... }
    
    // Authentication, navigation, cart, registration all mixed
}
```

#### After (Separated Files)
```java
// Hooks.java - Centralized setup
public class Hooks {
    @Before
    public void setUpActor() {
        StepContext.setCurrentActor(Users.user());
    }
}

// AuthenticationSteps.java - Focused responsibility
public class AuthenticationSteps {
    @When("User logs in with valid credentials")
    public void userLogsInWithValidCredentials(DataTable dataTable) {
        Actor user = StepContext.getCurrentActor();
        Map<String, String> credentials = extractCredentialsFromTable(dataTable);
        // Enhanced validation and error handling
    }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
2. **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
3. **Testability**: Individual step classes can be unit tested
4. **Reusability**: Common patterns extracted into utility methods
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added in appropriate files
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different step files

### Usage

The new step definitions work seamlessly with existing feature files. No changes to `.feature` files are required.

#### Example Feature File
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given User navigates to the home page
    When User logs in with valid credentials
      | email                    | password     |
      | test@example.com        | SecurePass123 |
    Then "Logged in as" label displays the username "TestUser"
```

### Next Steps

1. **Remove Deprecated File**: Once all tests pass with new structure, remove `AutomationExerciseSteps.java`
2. **Add Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for individual step definition classes
3. **Enhance Validation**: Add more comprehensive input validation
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics to track step execution times

### Best Practices

- Always use `StepContext.getCurrentActor()` to access the actor
- Validate DataTable inputs before processing
- Include descriptive JavaDoc for all public methods
- Follow the established naming conventions
- Keep step definitions focused on a single responsibility

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future test development and maintenance.
