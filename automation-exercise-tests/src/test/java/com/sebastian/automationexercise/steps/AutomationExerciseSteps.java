/**
 * @deprecated This class has been refactored and split into separate step definition classes for better organization:
 * - {@link NavigationSteps} for navigation-related steps
 * - {@link AuthenticationSteps} for login/logout steps  
 * - {@link RegistrationSteps} for user registration steps
 * - {@link ShoppingCartSteps} for shopping cart management steps
 * - {@link Hooks} for scenario setup and teardown
 * - {@link StepContext} for managing actor state across step files
 * 
 * This class should be removed once all step definitions have been migrated to the new structure.
 * 
 * The new structure provides:
 * - Better separation of concerns
 * - Improved maintainability
 * - Reduced code duplication
 * - Enhanced readability
 * - Better error handling and validation
